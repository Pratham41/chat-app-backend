# ABOUT THIS APP

This is backened for chat app.

I have used socket.io library for real-time messages. We can further improve the functionality by adding multiple things linke storing data in DB and so on.

I have just created a basic example.

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
then
### `npm run dev OR nom start` 

Runs the app in the development mode.
